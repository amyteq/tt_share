We call a positive integer $n$-Norwegian if it has three distinct positive divisors whose sum is equal to $n$. Let $f(n)$ denote the smallest $n$-Norwegian positive integer. Let $M=3^{2025!}$ and for a non-negative integer $c$ define \n\\begin{equation*}\n    g(c)=\\frac{1}{2025!}\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2025! f(M+c)}{M}\\right\\rfloor.\n\\end{equation*}\nWe can write \n\\begin{equation*}\n    g(0)+g(4M)+g(1848374)+g(10162574)+g(265710644)+g(44636594)=\\frac{p}{q}\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $p$ and $q$ are coprime positive integers. What is the remainder when $p+q$ is divided by $99991$?\n\nBudget: 900.00 seconds | Deadline: 1768376125.78\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"   Attempt  Response Length  Python Calls  Python Errors  Entropy  Answer\n0        7            23206            14              1    0.679   27243\n1        8            30986            53              3    0.720    8687\n2        1            31497            36              3    0.766    8687\n3        2            37775            69              8    0.689   41754\n4        3            40564            32              1    0.680   57280\n5        4            40350            72             22    0.680    8687\n6        5            50236            41              7    0.704      23\n7        6            59716            39              4    0.736    <NA>","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Attempt</th>\n      <th>Response Length</th>\n      <th>Python Calls</th>\n      <th>Python Errors</th>\n      <th>Entropy</th>\n      <th>Answer</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>23206</td>\n      <td>14</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0.679</td>\n      <td>27243</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>30986</td>\n      <td>53</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>0.720</td>\n      <td>8687</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>31497</td>\n      <td>36</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>0.766</td>\n      <td>8687</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>37775</td>\n      <td>69</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>0.689</td>\n      <td>41754</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>40564</td>\n      <td>32</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0.680</td>\n      <td>57280</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>40350</td>\n      <td>72</td>\n      <td>22</td>\n      <td>0.680</td>\n      <td>8687</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>6</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>50236</td>\n      <td>41</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>0.704</td>\n      <td>23</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>7</th>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>59716</td>\n      <td>39</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>0.736</td>\n      <td>&lt;NA&gt;</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"   Answer  Votes  Score\n0    8687      3  4.166\n1   27243      1  1.473\n2   57280      1  1.470\n3   41754      1  1.451\n4      23      1  1.421","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Answer</th>\n      <th>Votes</th>\n      <th>Score</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>8687</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>4.166</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>27243</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1.473</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>57280</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1.470</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>41754</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1.451</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>23</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1.421</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"\nFinal Answer: 8687\n\nDebug log written to P10.md\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":10}]}
