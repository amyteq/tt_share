In each race, two runners compete against each other with the faster runner always winning the race. The competition consists of $20$ rounds with each runner starting with a score of $0$. In each round, the runners are paired in such a way that in each pair, both runners have the same score at the beginning of the round. The winner of each race in the $i^{\\text{th}}$ round receives $2^{20-i}$ points and the loser gets no points.\n\nAt the end of the tournament, we rank the competitors according to their scores. Let $N$ denote the number of possible orderings of the competitors at the end of the tournament. Let $k$ be the largest positive integer such that $10^k$ divides $N$. What is the remainder when $k$ is divided by $10^{5}$?\n\nBudget: 900.00 seconds | Deadline: 1768463514.60\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"   Attempt  Response Length  Python Calls  Python Errors  Entropy  Answer\n0        1            12894            11              0    0.763   21818\n1        2            11472             3              0    0.840   21818\n2        3            18634            20              2    0.711    <NA>\n3        4             9956             8              2    0.810   21818\n4        5             6630             1              0    0.801   21818","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Attempt</th>\n      <th>Response Length</th>\n      <th>Python Calls</th>\n      <th>Python Errors</th>\n      <th>Entropy</th>\n      <th>Answer</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>12894</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.763</td>\n      <td>21818</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>11472</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.840</td>\n      <td>21818</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>18634</td>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0.711</td>\n      <td>&lt;NA&gt;</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>9956</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0.810</td>\n      <td>21818</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>6630</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.801</td>\n      <td>21818</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"   Answer  Votes  Score\n0   21818      4  4.984","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Answer</th>\n      <th>Votes</th>\n      <th>Score</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>21818</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>4.984</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"\nFinal Answer: 21818\n\nDebug log written to 424e18.md\n\nProblem: Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be the set of functions $\\alpha \\colon \\mathbb{Z}\\to \\mathbb{Z}$ for which there are only finitely many $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\\alpha(n) \\neq 0$. \n\nFor two functions $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in $\\mathcal{F}$, define their product $\\alpha\\star\\beta$ to be $\\sum\\limits_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\alpha(n)\\cdot \\beta(n)$.
